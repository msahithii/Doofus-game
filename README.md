Assignment: Doofus Adventure Game

Backstory:
Meet our character Doofus, a cube that loves exploring green platforms called Pulpits. The catch? Pulpits don't last long and disappear within seconds. Doofus has set a challenge to walk on at least 50 Pulpits. 

Characters/Props:
Doofus: The main character (a simple cube will work too).
Pulpit: A green metallic 9x9 platform where Doofus walks.

	
Goal:
Guide Doofus to walk on as many Pulpits as possible. Be cautious! If Doofus walks off the edge, he falls and the game ends.



Challenges:
Each Pulpit has a timer. When it runs out, the Pulpit is destroyed, and Doofus falls. You can check out the gameplay here: https://youtu.be/1MdT5c7FuRk


Controls:
Use arrow keys or WASD to move Doofus left, right, forward, or backward. The speed of Doofus is specified in the Doofus Diary (found here).

Pulpit Appearance:
Only two Pulpits can exist simultaneously. A new Pulpit appears when the timer of the previous one reaches a certain time (x seconds). Pulpits last for a random time between y and z seconds. They appear adjacent to the previous one, but not in the same position.

Note: x is a random number between y and z seconds obtained from the JSON file here. 

Scoring:
Doofus's score is based on how many Pulpits he successfully walks on.
